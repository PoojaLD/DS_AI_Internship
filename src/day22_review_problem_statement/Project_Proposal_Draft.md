📝 Work Summary

Today marked the transition from structured module-based learning to independent project development. The session focused on guiding students from theoretical understanding toward practical application through real-world problem statements.

1️⃣ Morning Review

Conducted a high-level recap of previously covered modules, emphasizing “when to use what” rather than detailed technical explanations. Discussed appropriate use cases for SQL, data cleaning, visualization, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and feature engineering.

2️⃣ Pitching the Problems

Presented five curated problem statements provided by mentors. For each problem, highlighted:

Real-world relevance and industry impact

Expected technical challenges

Required tools and methodologies

Estimated project complexity

3️⃣ Selection Clinic

Provided individual and group guidance to help students choose projects aligned with their current skill level while ensuring a meaningful learning challenge. Helped refine scope and feasibility.

🎯 Outcomes

Students gained clarity on project expectations.

Improved alignment between skill level and project complexity.

Reinforced understanding of applying concepts in real-world scenarios.

Transitioned from guided learning to independent execution mindset.
